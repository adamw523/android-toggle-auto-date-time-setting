So, at Google I/O we all got the Samsung Galaxy 10.1.  Yay!

The device is great, but still needs a little bit of work. One thing
causing a lot of people a lot of grief, is the inability to access the "set time automatically" setting in the _Date and Time_
settings. This is particularly bad because the device assumes that it should display the clock in GMT (I think).

Here's a quick little app to toggle that setting. [Direct link to the apk](https://github.com/adamw523/android-toggle-auto-date-time-setting/raw/master/TimeSettings.apk).
